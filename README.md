# Getting Started with Create React App
1. Use a Google Sheets API
Google Sheets can serve as a lightweight database for simple projects.

**Why Choose Google Sheets?**

* Free and easy to use.
* Accessible and shareable.
* Supports structured data with simple CRUD operations via the Google Sheets API.
**How to Use Google Sheets with Python**
1. Set Up Google Sheets API:

- Enable the Google Sheets API in the Google Cloud Console.
- Download credentials as a JSON file.

2. Install Dependencies:


`python3 -m pip install gspread oauth2client flask`

3. Example Backend with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

app = Flask(__name__)
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name("credentials.json", scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)
sheet = client.open("Your Google Sheet Name").sheet1

@app.route("/users", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data = request.json
    name = data.get("name")
    age = data.get("age")
    if not name or not age:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid input"}), 400
    sheet.append_row([name, age])
    return jsonify({"message": "User added"}), 201

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)
```
    
4. Test with Frontend:

     - Use http://localhost:5000/users as the endpoint.
Send a POST request with JSON data like:
json
Copy code
 ```js
 {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
} 
```

2. Use SQLite (Local Database)
SQLite is a simple, file-based relational database. It's lightweight, doesn't require a separate server, and is great for small projects.

Why Choose SQLite?
Built into Python (sqlite3 module).
Easy to manage with a single .db file.
Example Backend with Flask:
Install Flask:

`python3 -m pip install flask`
Code Example:

python
Copy code
```python
import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
DB_FILE = "users.db"


# Initialize SQLite database
def init_db():
    with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            age INTEGER NOT NULL
        )
        """)
        conn.commit()

@app.route("/users", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data = request.json
    name = data.get("name")
    age = data.get("age")
    if not name or not age:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid input"}), 400
    with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", (name, age))
        conn.commit()
        return jsonify({"message": "User added"}), 201

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_db()
    app.run(port=5000)
```

3. Use Firebase Realtime Database

Firebase is a hosted NoSQL database by Google that’s beginner-friendly and scalable.

**Why Choose Firebase?**
* Real-time data sync for frontend apps.
* Integrates well with Python using the firebase-admin SDK.
**
How to Use Firebase with Python:**

1. Set up a Firebase project.

2. Install dependencies:

`python3 -m pip install firebase-admin flask`

3. Implement API logic similar to the above examples.

**Recommendations**

* For a quick and collaborative option: Use Google Sheets.

* For local development with structure: Use SQLite.
* For scalability and real-time features: Use Firebase.

so actually could you layout the steps to do a react vite app front end using tan stact and python backend...

Here’s a step-by-step guide to building a React Vite app (frontend) with TanStack Query and a Python backend:

Frontend: React with Vite and TanStack Query
1. Initialize a Vite Project
bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install @tanstack/react-query axios
3. Set Up QueryClientProvider
Edit main.jsx to wrap your app in QueryClientProvider:

javascript
Copy code
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
4. Create the Form Component
Create a CreateUserForm.jsx file to send user data to the backend:


 import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import axios from "axios";

const CreateUserForm = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [age, setAge] = useState("");
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const mutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: (newUser) =>
      axios.post("http://localhost:5000/users", newUser),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(["users"]);
      setName("");
      setAge("");
    },
  });

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    mutation.mutate({ name, age: Number(age) });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Name"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        required
      />
      <input
        type="number"
        placeholder="Age"
        value={age}
        onChange={(e) => setAge(e.target.value)}
        required
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CreateUserForm; 

5. Update App.jsx
Import and use the CreateUserForm component:

javascript
Copy code
 import React from "react";
import CreateUserForm from "./CreateUserForm";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create User</h1>
      <CreateUserForm />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App; 

6. Start the Frontend

`npm run dev`

This will start the React app on http://localhost:5173.

Backend: Python with Flask
1. Set Up Python Environment
Create a Python virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Flask:

 python3 -m pip install flask 
2. Create the Backend Code
Create a file app.py with the following code:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory database (simple Python list for now)
users = []

@app.route("/users", methods=["POST"])
def create_user():
    data = request.json
    name = data.get("name")
    age = data.get("age")
    if not name or not age:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid input"}), 400
    new_user = {"id": len(users) + 1, "name": name, "age": age}
    users.append(new_user)
    return jsonify(new_user), 201

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=5000)
3. Test the Backend
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The server should be running on http://localhost:5000.
Use Postman or curl to test:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}'
Connecting Frontend and Backend
Test the Full Stack:

Start the Flask backend (python app.py).
Start the Vite frontend (npm run dev).
Use the form in the React app to submit data, which should be sent to the Python backend.
Optional Enhancements:

Add a GET route in the backend to fetch all users:
python
Copy code
@app.route("/users", methods=["GET"])
def get_users():
    return jsonify(users), 200
Use TanStack Query’s useQuery hook to display the list of users in the frontend.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
